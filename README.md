## 🚀 Get Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/reddit-analyzer.git
cd reddit-analyzer
npm install
```

### 2. Deploy your own backend

Use the provided backend repo to handle Reddit OAuth securely:

🔗 https://github.com/rodneyg/reddit-analyzer-backend

Deploy it on Render, set these environment variables:

```
REDDIT_CLIENT_ID=your_id
REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET=your_secret
REDDIT_USERNAME=your_reddit_username
REDDIT_PASSWORD=your_reddit_password
```

### 3. Connect frontend to backend

Update your frontend API route (e.g. route.ts) to point to your backend’s Render URL:

```javascript
const BASE_URL = "https://your-backend.onrender.com"
```

### 4. Start frontend locally

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then visit http://localhost:3000
